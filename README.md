# Text-to-Braille Converter
This is not a text-to-braille translator in the classical sense. Instead, it's a Python-based fork of [Image-to-Braille](https://github.com/505e06b2/Image-to-Braille) that applies to text inputs.
This project was created to enhance the twitch chat experience for retards like me from the forsen community
